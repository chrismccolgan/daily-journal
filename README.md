# Daily Journal
*A journal app incorporating the technologies I've learned along my coding journey.*

## December 2020
This journal started while I was in school. Originally it was all hardcoded HTML, then the entries were moved to a JSON file, and then CRUD functionality was added with JavaScript.

Currently I am in the process of converting this journal into a fullstack application with SQL, C#, .NET, and React.js.

## July 2020
A daily journal made with the concepts learned in class

Concepts include: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, modular code, CRUD functionality, array methods, object methods
