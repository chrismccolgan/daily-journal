# History

## March 2021

DailyJournal is now a fullstack app! The backend is coded with .NET, database with SQL, and frontend with React & React-Bootstrap.

Currently I am working on image upload capabilities, code cleanup, and user accounts and authorization with Google Firebase.

## December 2020

This journal started while I was in school. Originally it was all hardcoded HTML, then the entries were moved to a JSON file, and then CRUD functionality was added with JavaScript.

Currently I am in the process of converting this journal into a fullstack application with SQL, C#, .NET, and React.

## July 2020

A daily journal made with the concepts learned in class.

Concepts include: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, modular code, CRUD functionality, array methods, object methods
